- int accountNumber
- double balance
2: Protected Member:
- string accountHolderName
3: Public Member Functions:
- void setAccountDetails(int accNo, double bal, string name)
void displayAccountDetails()
Now, create a derived class SavingsAccount that inherits publicly from BankAccount:
Private Member:
double interestRate
Public Member Functions:
void setInterestRate(double rate)
void displayInterestRate()
void showAccountHolderName() (access the protected member accountHolderName from base class)
In the main() function:
Create an object of SavingsAccount.
Set account details and interest rate.
Display account details, interest rate, and account holderâ€™s name.
Try accessing accountNumber, balance, and accountHolderName directly from the object and comment the errors.

/*
This C++ program demonstrates the concept of **Inheritance**, **Access Specifiers**, and **Encapsulation** using a banking system example.

1. A base class `BankAccount` is created:
    - Private Data Members:
        - `accountNumber`: Stores the account number (private, so only accessible within the class).
        - `balance`: Stores the account balance (private).
    - Protected Data Member:
        - `accountHolderName`: Accessible in the base class and derived classes, but not outside the class.
    - Public Member Functions:
        - `setAccountDetails(int accNo, double bal, string name)`: Used to initialize account number, balance, and holder name.
        - `displayAccountDetails()`: Displays account number, balance, and account holder name.

2. A derived class `SavingsAccount` is created that **inherits publicly** from `BankAccount`:
    - Private Data Member:
        - `interestRate`: Stores the interest rate (private to SavingsAccount).
    - Public Member Functions:
        - `setInterestRate(double rate)`: Sets the interest rate for the savings account.
        - `displayInterestRate()`: Displays the current interest rate.
        - `showAccountHolderName()`: Accesses and displays the protected member `accountHolderName` from the base class.

3. In the `main()` function:
    - An object `s1` of `SavingsAccount` is created.
    - Account details are set using `setAccountDetails()`.
    - Interest rate is set using `setInterestRate()`.
    - The account details, interest rate, and account holder name (via a derived class function) are displayed.

4. Access Control Demonstration:
    - The last few lines (commented out) attempt to access private and protected members directly from `s1`:
        - `s1.accountNumber`, `s1.balance`: Cannot be accessed as they are **private** in `BankAccount`.
        - `s1.accountHolderName`: Cannot be accessed directly since it is **protected**, only accessible from inside the class or derived classes.
    - These lines are commented to prevent compiler errors, but demonstrate the importance of encapsulation and access specifiers.

5. Output of the Program:
    Account Details;
    Account Number: 12345  
    Balance: 10000.5  
    Account Holder: ABC  
    Interest Rate: 4.5%  
    Account Holder (from protected): ABC  

6. Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated:
    - **Encapsulation**: Using private and protected members to restrict access.
    - **Inheritance**: `SavingsAccount` inherits from `BankAccount`.
    - **Access Specifiers**: Shows the difference between private, protected, and public access.

This example is helpful for beginners to understand how object-oriented programming principles are applied in real-world scenarios.
